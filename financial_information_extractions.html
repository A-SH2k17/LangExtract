Meanwhile, when it comes to dividends, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ford</span></span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">stands out with its dividend yield of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">4.5%</span></span>, based on a regular quarterly dividend of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">15 cents</span>. The actual dividends have been even higher, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford has been paying special dividends to help reach its distribution target of between 40% and 50% of annual free cash flows</span>. This year, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford paid a supplemental dividend <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">of $0.15 to mark the company’s third consecutive special dividend</span></span>, after dishing out <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">$0.18</span> last year. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford paid a special dividend of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">$0.65</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2023</span></span>, after it booked a windfall gain on its investment in electric vehicle startup <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Rivian (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;">RIVN</span>)</span>.
Ford Should End Up Overshooting Its Payout Target in 2025

As things stand today, a supplemental dividend for 2026 is something we can rule out. In fact, looking at Ford’s adjusted free cash flow guidance of between $2 billion and $3 billion, it barely has the money to cover the base dividend at the midpoint. Notably, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Ford</span>’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2025</span> cash flows took a hit from the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fire incident at key supplier <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Novelis</span></span></span>. There was also the tariff impact, which is more of a recurring issue rather than a one<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">-off, unless these are waived.

Looking ahead, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford’s cash flows would be under pressure over the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">next couple of years</span> at least</span>. The company announced a massive <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">$19.5 billion charge in its EV business</span></span> earlier this month. Of this, $5.5 billion</span> would be in cash, which the company expects to incur over the next two years, with the majority coming in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2026</span>.

I believe the best-case scenario for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ford investors</span> would be the company maintaining its current payout, even as that might mean it overshoots the payout targets. Companies cut dividends only in dire scenarios, as was the case in 2020 when both Ford and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">General Motors</span> suspended their dividends altogether.
GM Prioritized Buybacks Over Dividends

Ideally, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Ford</span> should have <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">cut dividends</span> and instead used the free cash to either cut down debt or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">repurchase shares aggressively</span>, as GM did</span>. Notably, one of the reasons <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">GM outperformed Ford is because of the divergence in their capital allocation strategies</span>. While the Blue Oval has preferred dividends, its Detroit rival has prioritized buybacks, which, as I have said multiple times, made perfect sense given the tepid valuations.

There is the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">unstated “family element” in Ford’s capital allocation strategy</span>, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ford family</span> still owns <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">around 40%</span> of voting powers through Class B shares</span>. The family does not intend to sell its holdings and might prefer a dividend over a buyback, and that’s precisely what has been happening at Ford.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;">F</span> Stock Forecast</span>

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford has a consensus rating of “Hold” from the 23 analysts polled by Barchart</span>, while its mean target price of $12.39 is lower than current price levels. Even the Street-high target price of $15 is just about 13% higher.

Is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Ford</span> Stock a Buy for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2026</span>?

I share Wall Street’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">pessimism</span> and am not too bullish on Ford heading into 2026, and instead used the recent rise to trim my positions in the stock. Ford has <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">disappointed on multiple fronts</span>, ranging from execution, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">frequent and frustrating recalls</span>, where it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">shattered its own decade-old record</span> this year with 152 recalls, and less-than-optimal capital allocation. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ford</span>’s EV strategy has also been literally all over the place, and while I don’t entirely blame the company, given the industry-wide headwinds, the company’s EV performance and strategy leave a lot to be desired.

This divergence between Ford and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">GM</span></span> is well-articulated by their price action, where the latter has outperformed the Blue Oval for the second consecutive year. All said, while I don’t see Ford’s prospects as terribly bad for 2026, I would rather bet fresh capital on another name rather than Ford, given the company’s recent record on execution.
